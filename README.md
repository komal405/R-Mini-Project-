# R-Mini-Project-
We will go through the algorithm like Decision Trees.. For carrying out the credit card fraud detection, we will make use of the Card Transactions data set that contains a mix of fraud as well as non-fraudulent transactions.
         We will implement a decision tree algorithm. Decision Trees to plot the outcomes of a decision. These outcomes are basically a consequence through which we can conclude as to what class the object belongs to. We will now implement our decision tree model and will plot it using the rpart.plot() function. We will specifically use the recursive parting to plot the decision tree.
We used a variety of ML algorithms to implement this model and also plotted the respective performance curves for the models. We learn how data can be analyzed and visualized to discern fraudulent transactions from other types of data.
